    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this project is to analyse biodiversity data from the National Parks Service, particularly around various species observed in national parks.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project will scope, analyze, prepare, plot data, and seek to explain the findings from the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some of the questions that this project has sought to answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "- What is the distribution of conservation status for species?\n",
    "- Are certain types of species more likely to be endangered?\n",
    "- Are the differences between species and their conservation status significant?\n",
    "- Which animal is most prevalent and what is their distribution amongst parks?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data sources:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Both `Observations.csv` and `Species_info.csv` was provided by [Codecademy.com](https://www.codecademy.com).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: The data for this project is *inspired* by real data, but is mostly fictional."

    "## Scoping\n",
    "\n",
    "It is good practice to start any new project by creating a project scope. The sections below will outline and help guide the projects process and progress. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Project Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "The best place to start the projects scope is with the projects goals. This projects perspective will be through a biodiversity analyst for the National Parks Service (abbreviated to NPS going foward). The NPS wants to ensure the survival of endangered and at-risk species in order to maintain the level of biodeiversity within their parks. Therefore, the main objectives of an analyst will be understanding characterists of the species within the parks and their conservation status, also those species relationship to the national parks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- What is the distribution of conservation status for species?\n",
    "- Are certain types of species more likely to be endangered?\n",
    "- Are the differences between species and their conservation status significant?\n",
    "- Which animal is most prevalent and what is their distribution amongst parks? \n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "\n",
    "This project has two data sets that came with the package. The first `csv` file has information about each species and another has observations of species with park locations. This data will be used to analyze the goals of the project. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "This section is where the decriptive statistics and data visualisation techniques are emplyed to better understand the data. Tools such as statistical inference will also be used to test if the observed values are statistically significant. Some of the key metrics to be computed include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Distributions\n",
    "1. counts\n",
    "1. relationship between species\n",
    "1. conservation status of species\n",
    "1. observations of species in parks. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, it's a good idea to revisit the goals and check if the output of the analysis corresponds to the questions first set to be answered (in the goals section). This section will also reflect on what has been learned through the process, and if any of the questions were unable to be answered. This could also include limitations or if any of the analysis could have been done using different methodologies.\n"
